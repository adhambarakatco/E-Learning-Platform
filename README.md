# E-Learning Platform with Adaptive Modules and Performance Tracking

## Overview
The E-Learning Platform is a feature-rich web application designed to provide an interactive and personalized learning experience for students, instructors, and administrators. The platform integrates adaptive learning modules, performance tracking, and secure user management to ensure a seamless educational journey. It leverages modern web technologies including NestJS, MongoDB, and Next.js to deliver a robust and scalable solution.

## Key Features

### 1. **User Management**
- **Authentication and Role-Based Access**: Secure login and registration with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for students, instructors, and administrators.
- **Profile Management**: Users can update personal information, track progress, and monitor their course history.

### 2. **Course Management**
- **Course Creation and Organization**: Instructors can create, organize, and update courses with multimedia resources such as videos and PDFs.
- **Search and Enrollment**: Students can search for courses by topic or instructor and enroll in them.
- **Version Control**: Instructors can update course materials while maintaining access to previous versions.

### 3. **Interactive Learning Modules**
- **Quizzes and Assessments**: Adaptive quizzes adjust question difficulty based on student performance.
- **Instant Feedback**: Students receive real-time feedback on quizzes to help identify areas for improvement.

### 4. **Performance Tracking**
- **Student Dashboard**: A visual representation of progress, including course completion rates and average scores.
- **Instructor Analytics**: Provides reports on student engagement and assessment results for targeted teaching strategies.

### 5. **Security & Data Protection**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Ensures each user has access only to the appropriate resources.
- **Data Backup**: Regular backups of user data and course progress to prevent data loss.

### 6. **Communication Features**
- **Real-Time Chat**: Enables interaction between instructors and students, as well as peer communication.
- **Discussion Forums**: Course-specific forums moderated by instructors for in-depth discussions.
- **Notifications**: Users receive alerts for new messages, replies, and important updates.

### 7. **Additional Features**
- **Quick Notes**: A tool for students to create and organize notes tied to specific courses or modules.
- **Adaptive Recommendation Engine** (Data Science): AI-powered recommendations based on user engagement and performance.
- **Biometric Authentication**: Secure exam authentication using biometric data.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: NestJS (Node.js, TypeScript)
- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (Flexible, scalable storage)
- **Authentication**: JWT and bcrypt for secure login
- **Security**: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **Additional**: Python-based recommendation engine, third-party biometric authentication SDKs (e.g., FaceIO, FingerprintJS)

## Database Schema
The platform uses a MongoDB database with the following collections:
- **Users**: Stores user details, including roles (student, instructor, admin).
- **Courses**: Details about each course, including course content and metadata.
- **Modules**: Content and resources within a course.
- **Quizzes and Responses**: Quizzes for interactive learning and user responses.
- **Progress**: Tracks user course progress.
- **Notes**: Quick notes created by students tied to specific courses.
- **Recommendations**: Personalized course recommendations based on user interactions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/e-learning-platform.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd e-learning-platform
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set up the environment variables** in a `.env` file:
   - `DB_URI`: MongoDB connection string
   - `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT authentication
   - Other environment variables as required

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the platform**:
   - The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
   - The backend will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.
